This example highlights a common error when working with instance variables in Ruby. Directly manipulating instance variables using `instance_variable_set` bypasses any potential validation or logic encapsulated within accessor methods.  While functional, this approach can lead to unintended consequences and makes code harder to maintain and debug.  The solution shows how to use accessor methods for better encapsulation.
